# Telecom Idle

Telecom Idle is an incremental idle-style game that follows communication technology from hand-delivered messages to modern telecom infrastructure. Players progress by unlocking new communication methods, automating delivery, and scaling throughput over time.

## Project Goals

- Capture the historical progression of telecommunications as gameplay milestones.
- Provide both active clicking and offline idle growth mechanics.
- Support modular content updates for new eras and systems.

## Getting Started

The repository is in early setup. Initial tasks include defining gameplay loops, building the core idle economy systems, and establishing UI/UX foundations. Further documentation and development guidelines will be added as the project matures.

## Contributing

Pending future decisions on project structure and tooling. For now, contributions focus on foundational design docs and prototypes.
