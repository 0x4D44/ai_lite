# 2025.10.01 - AI Idle High-Level Design

## 1. Purpose & Scope
- Retheme the original Telecom Idle concept into an AI innovation tycoon while keeping core mechanics and balance intact.
- Provide guidance for updating data definitions, Zustand stores, and UI copy to align with the new fiction.
- Document naming conventions and entity mappings so future balance work stays coherent.

## 2. Experience Goals
- Maintain the accelerating number growth loop while emphasizing breakthroughs in AI capability.
- Showcase clear leaps in sophistication with each era, mirroring historical AI milestones.
- Keep active decisions meaningful through workforce (talent) allocation, research queue management, and manual boosts.

## 3. Core Terminology & Resource Mapping
- Funding (`money`): primary currency representing capital and revenue from AI services.
- Talent (`workforce`): available specialists; expanded via upgrades and research.
- Research (`tech`): formalized breakthroughs unlocking eras and projects.
- Data Flow (`bandwidth`): volume of curated data and deployment reach.
- Compute (`compute`): GPU/TPU capacity powering training and inference.
- Manual boost becomes Hackathon Sprint; same stats, new label and FX text.

- No further unlock yet; hooks remain for prestige or future eras.

## 5. Research Programs (`src/data/researchProjects.ts`)
- Logistics Analytics -> Label Efficiency Analytics (global funding +20%).
- Advanced Signal Theory -> Optimization Algorithms (global research +30%).
- Training Consortium -> Talent Exchange Program (talent +12).
- Bandwidth Overlays -> Synthetic Data Overlays (global data flow +40%).
- Software-Defined Networks -> Policy Gradient Infrastructure (global research/data flow +25%).
- Unlock eras stay the same; only strings need updating.

## 6. Pod Strategy (`src/data/pods.ts`)
- Ingress Gateway Pods -> Data Ingestion Nodes (compute upkeep 150; +20% funding, +10% data flow).
- Service Mesh Pods -> Feature Engineering Pods (upkeep 220; +25% research, +15% data flow).
- Observability Stack Pods -> Model Monitoring Stack (upkeep 180; +15% funding, +20% compute).
- AI Optimizer Pods -> Autonomous Optimizer Pods (upkeep 350; +35% funding, +30% research, +25% data flow).
- No mechanical shifts; update display names/descriptions.

## 7. Store & State Considerations
- `src/state/gameStore.ts` continues to import era data; only era module content changes.
- Update UI selectors that surface resource labels (e.g., dashboard headings, tooltips) to use new terminology while keeping internal ids intact.
- Manual boost label and description should change alongside any tooltip text defined in UI components.
- Verify preset statistics/profile copy (if any) references telecom terms; swap for AI equivalents.

## 8. UI Copy Touchpoints
- Era selection modal / progression banners.
- Unit cards, upgrade cards, research entries, pod selector.
- Manual boost button text and cooldown tooltip ("Hackathon Sprint active").
- Empty states for talent shortage and data flow gating.
- Leaderboard blurb (if referencing telecom) to mention "total funding" and "agent runtime".

## 9. Art & Audio Hooks
- Palette can shift from copper/bronze telecom hues to neon blues and vibrant magentas.
- Consider new iconography: dataset symbols, GPU chips, robot silhouettes.
- Optional ambient sound update: server room hum, robotic servo cues for feedback.

## 10. Implementation Steps
1. Update era data modules (`src/data/eras/*.ts`) with new names, flavor text, and descriptive copy while retaining ids and numerical values.
2. Apply the research and pod renames in `src/data/researchProjects.ts` and `src/data/pods.ts`, double-checking descriptions and UI-facing fields.
3. Standardize resource terminology across shared UI components (dashboards, tooltips, status bars) to Funding, Talent, Research, Data Flow, and Compute.
4. Rename the manual boost action to Hackathon Sprint everywhere it appears (store constants, UI button label, cooldown messaging) and verify persistence keys remain unchanged.
5. Sweep remaining legacy telecom copy in `src/components` (era modals, unit/upgrade cards, empty states) to align with the new AI fiction, including leaderboard labels.
6. Refresh automated tests or snapshots that assert on text content, and add quick checks for the renamed resources if coverage gaps exist.
7. Adjust visual theming assets (colors, icons) referenced in stylesheets or SVGs to match the AI aesthetic, coordinating with any design tooling.
8. Run a regression QA pass: load existing saves, progress through each era, and confirm narrative consistency and balance remain intact.
